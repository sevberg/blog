This is my first post on my new blog. It won't say anything meaningful or interesting, so you're really wasting your time right now by reading it. Not kidding, stop reading this. I mean, I guess it's really up to you really what you do with you're life, but if I were in your shoes I would have stopped by now. But no. You're still reading this. But why!? I can't understand it. Maybe it means...you care?? Wow, that's really sweet of you. But now I'll have to stop this to save you from yourself. Because otherwise you would keep on suffering. So I guess, in the end, I'm the true hero of this story!
